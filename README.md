# Attendance-tracker
A Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition is a website that recognizes the face and marks the attendance for the recognized faces in an excel sheet. Also it has some extra features like Gender Recognition and Emotion Recognition.

# ABOUT MY PROJECT

In my project, via face recognition technology, the face in front of the camera will be identified and matched with the database and if a match is found then under the detected face, the name of the person will be shown and the attendance will be stored in an Excel file with the name of that person and also the date and timing of the appearance of that person in front of the camera. So no need to track the attendance with pen and paper. Simply detecting the face the attendance can be marked.

# EXTRA FEATURRES

Emotion Recognition & Gender Recognition

There are some amazing extra features like -Emotion Detection , Gender Detection. On detecting the face, it will also give the Gender of a person and also it will do Emotion Detection like if that person is happy , sad, angry, neutral.

# TECNOLOGY USED

Python | Machine Learning

# Python | Machine Learning

OpenCv - using OpenCv the image will be captured from the webcamera and will read the image.

face_recognition - It will recognize the image and will match with the dataset that it is present or not, by finding 128 unique face encodings by HOG algorithm.

Numpy- it will find the minimum face distance index.

Deepface - emotion and gender recogniton.

Streamlit- using streamlit I have made the Web browser.
